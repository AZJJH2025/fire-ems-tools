# Cache Bust File

This file forces new deployments when Render cache is stuck.

Last updated: July 12, 2025 at 8:20 PM - SECOND ATTEMPT

Deployment issue: Production STILL showing June 13, 2025 build instead of July 12, 2025 fixes.
All fixes are committed and should be live, but Render CDN is serving cached content.

Console logs from user confirm:
- Build timestamp: "FRESH BUILD JUN 13 2025"
- Tool routing error: "Tool ID not recognized: water-supply-coverage" 
- Data corruption bug: Address fields still being split incorrectly
