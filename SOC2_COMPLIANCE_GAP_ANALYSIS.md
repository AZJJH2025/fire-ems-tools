2. **Engage SOC 2 consultant** for gap assessment
3. **Begin policy development** (start with Information Security Policy)
4. **Implement centralized logging** (ELK stack or similar)

### **Short-term Actions (Next 90 Days)**
1. **Complete policy framework** (all required policies)
2. **Implement database encryption at rest**
3. **Set up comprehensive monitoring**
4. **Establish incident response procedures**

### **Long-term Actions (6-12 months)**
1. **Complete technical control implementation**
2. **Conduct pre-audit assessment**
3. **Perform Type I SOC 2 audit**
4. **Plan for Type II SOC 2 audit**

## Alternative Compliance Frameworks

If SOC 2 is too extensive, consider:

### **ISO 27001** (International Standard)
- More framework-focused
- Internationally recognized
- Self-certification possible
- Lower initial cost

### **FedRAMP** (Government Focus)
- Required for federal government
- Higher security requirements
- Longer implementation timeline
- Higher compliance costs

### **HIPAA** (Healthcare Focus)
- Relevant for EMS data
- Specific to healthcare
- Less comprehensive than SOC 2
- Industry-specific requirements

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: FireEMS.ai has strong technical security controls but lacks the organizational and operational controls required for SOC 2 compliance.

**Estimated Timeline**: 8-12 months for full SOC 2 readiness
**Estimated Cost**: $150,000-300,000 in first year (including audit)
**Complexity**: High - requires significant organizational change

**Recommendation**: Start with foundational policies and monitoring, then gradually build toward SOC 2 compliance over 12-18 months. Consider engaging a SOC 2 consultant early in the process to ensure proper framework implementation.
