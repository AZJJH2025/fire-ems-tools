# Station Coverage Optimizer - User Guide

## Overview

The Station Coverage Optimizer helps fire departments analyze and optimize fire station placement for maximum coverage effectiveness. This tool ensures compliance with NFPA 1710 (urban) and NFPA 1720 (rural/volunteer) standards while identifying coverage gaps and optimization opportunities.

## Understanding Coverage Standards

### NFPA 1710 (Career/Urban Departments)
- **Response Time Goal**: 4 minutes travel time to 90% of incidents
- **Turnout Time**: 60 seconds for EMS, 80 seconds for fire
- **Staffing**: Minimum 4 personnel on first arriving unit
- **Coverage Area**: Typically 1.5-2.5 mile radius per station

### NFPA 1720 (Volunteer/Rural Departments)
- **Response Time Goals**: Varies by population density and risk
- **Turnout Time**: More flexible based on volunteer availability
- **Staffing**: Varies based on volunteer response
- **Coverage Area**: Larger areas, up to 5-10 mile radius

## Getting Started

### Step 3: Configure Analysis Parameters
Set your department's specific requirements:
- **Coverage Standard**: NFPA 1710, 1720, or custom standards
- **Response Time Goals**: Target travel times for different incident types
- **Coverage Radius**: Distance-based or time-based coverage areas
- **Population Areas**: High-risk areas requiring enhanced coverage
