# Security Testing for Fire-EMS Tools

This document outlines the security testing approach for the Fire-EMS Tools application, focusing on common web application vulnerabilities and HIPAA compliance considerations.

## Overview

Security testing is a critical component of our testing strategy, especially given that the application handles sensitive emergency and medical data subject to HIPAA regulations. Our security testing focuses on:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. Session management
4. CSRF protection
5. Rate limiting
6. Directory traversal protection
7. SQL injection prevention
8. XSS prevention

## Security Test Implementation

Our security tests are implemented as end-to-end (E2E) tests using Playwright, which allows us to validate security measures from a user's perspective.

### Test Categories

#### Authentication Testing

- Verifies login functionality with valid and invalid credentials
- Tests protection of authenticated routes
- Validates session timeout functionality
- Tests password strength requirements
- Verifies secure cookie properties

#### Authorization Testing

- Validates that users can only access resources appropriate for their role
- Tests that read-only users cannot perform write operations
- Verifies department-specific data isolation
- Tests for horizontal privilege escalation vulnerabilities

#### Input Validation

- Tests form validation for all input fields
- Validates handling of special characters and potentially malicious input
- Tests file upload restrictions and validation

#### XSS Prevention

- Tests for reflected XSS vulnerabilities in search forms and error messages
- Tests for stored XSS vulnerabilities in user-generated content
- Validates HTML escaping in data display

#### CSRF Protection

- Verifies CSRF token implementation on all forms
- Tests that requests without valid CSRF tokens are rejected
- Validates token rotation after authentication

#### Injection Prevention

- Tests SQL injection prevention in search forms and filters
- Validates handling of special characters in database queries
- Tests NoSQL injection prevention where applicable

#### Rate Limiting

- Tests rate limiting on login attempts
- Validates API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Tests account lockout procedures

#### Other Security Controls

- Tests for directory traversal vulnerabilities
- Validates secure HTTP headers
- Tests for sensitive information disclosure

## Running Security Tests

Security tests are integrated into our E2E testing framework and can be run using:

```
./run_e2e_tests.sh --test-match="security.spec.js"
```

## HIPAA Compliance Testing

In addition to general security testing, we include specific tests related to HIPAA compliance:

1. **Audit Logging**: Verify that all access to PHI (Protected Health Information) is properly logged
2. **Data Encryption**: Validate that PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit
3. **Access Controls**: Test role-based access to sensitive information
4. **Data Integrity**: Verify that PHI cannot be improperly modified
5. **Authentication**: Test multi-factor authentication where required

## Automated Security Scanning

In addition to our E2E security tests, we recommend using the following automated security tools:

1. **OWASP ZAP**: For automated vulnerability scanning
2. **Snyk**: For dependency vulnerability scanning
3. **ESLint Security Plugin**: For static code analysis
4. **PyUp**: For Python dependency scanning

## Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Run security tests as part of every build
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing in addition to automated tests
3. **Security Reviews**: Perform code reviews with a security focus
4. **Stay Updated**: Keep dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities
5. **Defense in Depth**: Don't rely on a single security control
6. **Fail Securely**: Ensure that failures default to a secure state
7. **Input Validation**: Validate all input on both client and server side

## Incident Response

If security tests reveal vulnerabilities:

1. Assess the severity and potential impact
2. Document the vulnerability in detail
3. Fix the vulnerability with appropriate controls
4. Write regression tests to prevent recurrence
5. Review similar code for the same pattern of vulnerability

## Conclusion

Security testing is an ongoing process that must evolve with the application and the threat landscape. By integrating security testing into our CI/CD pipeline, we maintain a strong security posture and protect sensitive HIPAA-regulated data.
