# Database Reliability Fixes for Authentication Issues

## Problem Summary

The authentication system was experiencing SSL SYSCALL errors and connection drops causing:
- 500 server errors during login attempts
- Multiple login attempts required (1-3 tries)
- `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected`

## Root Cause

**PostgreSQL connection instability** between Render and the database:
- SSL handshake failures
- Network interruptions
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Database connection drops mid-query

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Connection Pooling (`config.py`)

```python
SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
    'pool_size': 10,                    # Base connection pool size
    'max_overflow': 20,                 # Additional connections when needed
    'pool_pre_ping': True,              # Test connections before use
    'pool_recycle': 3600,               # Recycle connections every hour
    'pool_reset_on_return': 'commit',   # Clean up on connection return
    'connect_args': {
        'connect_timeout': 30,          # 30 second connection timeout
        'keepalives_idle': 600,         # Send keepalive every 10 minutes
        'keepalives_interval': 30,      # Keepalive probe interval
        'keepalives_count': 3          # 3 failed keepalives = dead connection
    }
}
```

### 2. Database Retry Logic (`database_utils.py`)

Created comprehensive retry system with:
- **Exponential backoff**: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s delays
- **Selective retry**: Only retries connection/network errors
- **Smart error detection**: Identifies SSL SYSCALL and connection drops
- **Logging**: Tracks retry attempts and success/failure

```python
@with_database_retry()
def database_operation():
    # Any database operation automatically gets retry logic
```

### 3. Authentication Route Enhancements (`routes/auth.py`)

Updated login function with:
- **Retry-wrapped user lookup**: `@retry_db_query`
- **Retry-wrapped login updates**: `@retry_db_write`
- **Graceful error handling**: Better logging and error messages

### 4. Database Health Monitoring

Added `/auth/api/health/database` endpoint that provides:
- Connection health status
- Pool statistics (active/idle connections)
- Query test results
- Real-time monitoring data

## Environment Variables (Optional)

You can customize the behavior with these environment variables:

```bash
# Connection pool settings
DB_POOL_SIZE=10                 # Base pool size
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=20              # Additional connections
DB_POOL_RECYCLE=3600            # Connection lifetime (seconds)

# Connection timeouts
DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30           # Connection timeout
DB_KEEPALIVES_IDLE=600          # Keepalive idle time
DB_KEEPALIVES_INTERVAL=30       # Keepalive interval
DB_KEEPALIVES_COUNT=3           # Failed keepalives before disconnect
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Authentication Reliability

```bash
# Test login endpoint multiple times
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST https://fireems.ai/auth/api/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"admin@fireems.ai","password":"FireEMS2025!"}'
  echo "Test $i completed"
done
```

### 2. Monitor Database Health

```bash
# Check database health status
curl https://fireems.ai/auth/api/health/database
```

Expected healthy response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database_connection": true,
  "query_test": true,
  "user_count": 1,
  "connection_pool": {
    "pool_size": 10,
    "checked_in": 8,
    "checked_out": 2,
    "overflow": 0,
    "invalid": 0
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-07-11T17:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### 3. Watch Logs for Improvements

Look for these log patterns:

**Before (Problematic)**:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```
üîÑ Database operation attempt 1/3: find_user_by_email
‚úÖ Database health check passed
üîå Database connection dropped during find_user_by_email (attempt 1): SSL EOF error
‚è≥ Retrying find_user_by_email in 1.0 seconds...
‚úÖ LOGIN DEBUG: User found - ID: 1, Email: admin@fireems.ai
```

## Expected Results

- **Login success rate**: Should improve from ~33% to ~95%+
- **Retry behavior**: Failed connections automatically retry with backoff
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoint provides real-time connection status
- **Resilience**: System recovers from temporary database issues

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur, temporarily revert by:

1. Remove `SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS` from `config.py`
2. Remove retry decorators from `routes/auth.py`
3. Restart the application

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- config.py routes/auth.py
# Then redeploy
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor authentication success rates** in production
2. **Review health check metrics** for connection pool utilization
3. **Adjust pool sizes** if needed based on actual usage patterns
4. **Implement similar retry logic** in other critical database operations
