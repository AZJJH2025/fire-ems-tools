// Data1G.csv handling fix

/* 
This patch addresses the issue with Data1G.csv file processing in emergency mode, 
where the system was only processing 5 records. The fixes include:

1. Increased record limits in emergency fallback from 5 to 1000 records for Data1G.csv
2. Added filename detection and storage to identify large files like Data1G.csv
3. Improved data chunking to handle large files better - now uses 500-1000 records
4. Added enhanced logging for large file processing
*/

Console: When processing Data1G.csv, the system will now use enhanced processing mode 
and significantly more records (1000 instead of 5) to provide better data quality.
