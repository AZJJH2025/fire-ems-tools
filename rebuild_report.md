# Rebuild and Deploy Report

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Debugging Code Found in Source
- **Location**: `/Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/react-app/src/components/analyzer/ResponseTimeAnalyzerContainer.tsx`
- **Pattern Found**: `üîç NORMALIZE FUNCTION CALLED - Processing`
- **Line**: `console.log('üîç NORMALIZE FUNCTION CALLED - Processing', records.length, 'records');`

### ‚ùå Debugging Code Missing from Build
- **Current App Directory**: `/Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/app/`
- **Current Dist Directory**: `/Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/react-app/dist/`
- **Status**: Neither the current app nor dist directories contain the debugging code

### üîç Analysis
The debugging code exists in the source TypeScript file but is not present in the compiled JavaScript bundles. This indicates that:

1. The React app needs to be rebuilt to include the latest source changes
2. The current deployed version is from an older build that doesn't include the enhanced debugging

## Issue with Shell Execution
Encountered persistent shell execution issues that prevented automatic rebuild:
```
zsh:source:1: no such file or directory: /var/folders/h4/d5vm3t5x35d4w2wdglq70_hm0000gn/T/claude-shell-snapshot-dc17
```

## Manual Solution Required

To fix the missing enhanced debugging code, you need to manually execute these commands:

### Step 1: Navigate to React App Directory
```bash
cd /Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/react-app
```

### Step 2: Clean Previous Build
```bash
rm -rf dist
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
```

### Step 3: Build React App
```bash
npm run build-no-check
```

### Step 4: Deploy to App Directory
```bash
cd /Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools
rm -rf app
cp -r react-app/dist app
```

### Step 5: Fix HTML Asset Paths
```bash
sed -i '' 's|"/assets/|"/app/assets/|g' /Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/app/*.html
```

### Step 6: Verify Debugging Code
```bash
grep -r "NORMALIZE FUNCTION CALLED" /Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/app/assets/
```

## Expected Result

After completing these steps, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Enhanced debugging messages in browser console when using Response Time Analyzer
- ‚úÖ Console output like: `üîç NORMALIZE FUNCTION CALLED - Processing X records`
- ‚úÖ Detailed field debugging information during data processing

## Files that Need the Enhanced Build

1. `ResponseTimeAnalyzerContainer-*.js` - Contains the normalize function with debugging
2. `index-*.js` - Main application bundle
3. `App-*.js` - Application component
4. `*.html` files - Need correct asset paths

## Alternative: Use Existing Scripts

You can also run the rebuild script that was created for this purpose:
```bash
cd /Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools
python3 rebuild_and_deploy.py
```

## Current State Summary

- **Source Code**: ‚úÖ Contains enhanced debugging
- **Dist Build**: ‚ùå Missing enhanced debugging  
- **App Deploy**: ‚ùå Missing enhanced debugging
- **Action Required**: Manual rebuild and deploy

The enhanced debugging code is ready in the source files and just needs to be built and deployed to become active.
