# Data Formatter/Transformer Integration Fixes

## Previous Fixes
- Fixed field naming issues (standardized field names based on schema)
- Fixed datetime format issues (ISO 8601 UTC with 'Z' suffix)
- Fixed schema structure mismatch (proper requiredFields/optionalFields)
- Added schema generation script

## Current Problem
The "Send to tool" functionality between the Data Formatter and other tools like the Response Time Analyzer was broken. When sending data from the Data Formatter to other tools, the data wouldn't display correctly, resulting in 404 errors or missing charts and heatmaps. Direct file uploads worked fine.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The system was incorrectly treating the `from_formatter=true` URL parameter as an indicator to activate emergency mode
2. This caused the application to look for data in localStorage (used by emergency mode) rather than in sessionStorage (used by normal Data Formatter flow)
3. The conflict was in the emergency mode detection logic in multiple files

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified `fire-ems-dashboard.js` to explicitly separate the emergency mode logic from the Data Formatter flow:
   - Updated the isEmergencyMode flag to only check for actual emergency parameters
   - Added more detailed logging for debugging
   - Clarified the sessionStorage data processing flow

2. Modified `emergency-mode-library.js` to respect the separation between:
   - Emergency data flow (using localStorage and emergency_data parameter)
   - Normal Data Formatter flow (using sessionStorage and from_formatter parameter)

3. Added better diagnostic logging to trace data flow throughout the system

## Testing
The fix should be tested by:
1. Using the Data Formatter to prepare data and using "Send to tool" to send it to the Response Time Analyzer
2. Checking that charts and maps appear correctly after the data transfer
3. Verifying that emergency mode is not triggered unnecessarily

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for both data flow paths
2. Implement clear UI indicators showing the data source (direct upload vs. from formatter)
3. Add more robust feature detection across all data reception code
4. Create unit tests for both normal and emergency data flows
