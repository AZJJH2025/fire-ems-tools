COMPREHENSIVE DATA FORMATTER DOCUMENTATION:

PURPOSE & WORKFLOW:
- Transform raw CAD exports into standardized format for Fire EMS Tools analysis
- Complete workflow: Upload ‚Üí Auto-Map ‚Üí Manual Adjust ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Export
- Supports all major CAD vendors: Tyler, Hexagon, Console One, TriTech

SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS:
- CSV (Comma Separated Values) - Primary format
- Excel (.xlsx, .xls) - Automatically converted
- TSV (Tab Separated) - Common CAD export format
- Text files with delimiters

KEY FEATURES:
- Smart Auto-Mapping: Detects field patterns from major CAD systems
- Manual Field Mapping: Drag-and-drop interface for precise control
- Live Preview: Real-time data validation and preview
- Data Quality Analysis: AI-powered 0-100% quality scoring
- Template Management: Save and reuse mappings for monthly workflows
- Export Integration: Direct export to all Fire EMS analysis tools

FIELD MAPPING PROCESS:
1. Upload: System analyzes CSV structure and field names
2. Auto-Detection: Recognizes common patterns (Tyler "ALARM_TIME", Console One "INC_DATE_TIME")
3. Target Fields Panel: Shows required/optional fields for selected analysis tool
4. Manual Mapping: Drag source fields to target fields or use dropdown selection
5. Validation: Real-time validation with red/green indicators
6. Live Preview: Bottom panel shows transformed data sample

COMMON FIELD MAPPING ISSUES:
- Split Date/Time: CAD exports often separate "Date" and "Time" - combine to datetime field
- Field Name Variations: "Call Time" vs "Incident Time" vs "Alarm Time" - all valid
- Required vs Optional: Red "Required" fields must be mapped, blue "Optional" enhance analysis
- Data Types: Ensure time fields map to TIME targets, not DATE targets
- Geographic Data: Address parsing for city/state, coordinate extraction from POINT data

CAD VENDOR SPECIFICS:
- Tyler Technologies: Mixed naming conventions, "ALARM_TIME", "INCIDENT_DATE"
- Console One: Underscore format, "INC_DATE_TIME", "PROBLEM_TYPE", "UNIT_ID"  
- Hexagon/Intergraph: PascalCase, "CallDateTime", "DispatchDateTime"
- TriTech/CentralSquare: Underscore case, "EventNum", "Call_Date_Time"

DATA QUALITY FEATURES:
- AI Analysis: Comprehensive quality scoring based on completeness, accuracy
- Tool Compatibility: Shows which analysis tools work best with current data
- Missing Field Detection: Identifies gaps in critical data
- Format Validation: Ensures data types match tool requirements
- Improvement Suggestions: AI recommendations for better data quality

EXPORT OPTIONS:
- Send to Response Time Analyzer: NFPA 1710 compliance analysis
- Send to Fire Map Pro: Geographic incident mapping and coverage analysis
- Send to Water Supply Coverage: Tank and hydrant coverage analysis
- Download Clean CSV: Standardized format for other systems
- Professional Reports: Integration with report generation tools

TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES:
- "800+ minute response times": Usually indicates date-only field mapped to time field
- "No fields auto-mapped": Check field naming conventions, try manual mapping
- "Required fields missing": Ensure all red "Required" fields have source mappings
- "Data looks wrong in preview": Check field mapping accuracy, verify source data
- "Export fails": Validate all required fields are properly mapped

PROFESSIONAL USE CASES:
- Monthly CAD processing: Create templates for recurring workflows
- Multi-department sharing: Export templates for mutual aid departments
- Compliance reporting: Ensure data meets NFPA/NEMSIS standards
- Grant applications: Professional data packages for funding requests

COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TIME ANALYZER DOCUMENTATION:

PURPOSE & NFPA 1710 STANDARDS:
- Professional NFPA 1710 compliance analysis and reporting
- Standards: ‚â§60 sec dispatch, ‚â§60 sec turnout, ‚â§240 sec travel, ‚â§300 sec total
- 90th percentile measurement (90% of calls must meet standards)
- Color-coded compliance: Green = compliant, Red = non-compliant

CORE CALCULATIONS:
- Dispatch Time: Call received ‚Üí Units notified (Target: ‚â§60 seconds)
- Turnout Time: Units notified ‚Üí En route (Target: ‚â§60 seconds)  
- Travel Time: En route ‚Üí On scene (Target: ‚â§240 seconds)
- Total Response: Call received ‚Üí On scene (Target: ‚â§300 seconds ALS)
- Scene Time: On scene ‚Üí Clear/available (Operational metric)

REQUIRED DATA FIELDS:
- Incident ID: Unique identifier for each call
- Incident Date: Date of the emergency call
- Incident Time: Complete timestamp of call received
- Optional but valuable: Dispatch time, en route time, arrival time, clear time

GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS:
- Interactive incident map with color-coded response times
- Blue markers: Good performance (meeting NFPA standards)
- Red markers: Performance needs improvement
- Coverage area analysis with response time heatmaps
- Station coverage assessment and optimization recommendations

PROFESSIONAL REPORTING:
- Monthly Compliance Reports: Official NFPA 1710 compliance documentation
- Executive Summaries: High-level performance for city managers/councils
- Grant Application Data: Professional data packages for funding requests
- Annual Performance Reports: Comprehensive year-end analysis
- Custom Reports: Configurable sections and metrics

DATA QUALITY INTELLIGENCE:
- Smart data validation: Detects unrealistic times (800+ minutes)
- Missing data handling: Professional "N/A" display vs false calculations
- Date-only detection: Prevents incorrect calculations from incomplete timestamps
- Timezone handling: Proper local time parsing and conversion
- Quality scoring: Data completeness and accuracy assessment

COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
- Unrealistic Response Times (800+ minutes):
  * Root cause: Date-only field mapped to incident_time instead of datetime
  * Solution: Re-map "Call Received Date/Time" to TIME field in Data Formatter
  * Prevention: Ensure datetime fields include time component
- Missing Time Data:
  * Symptom: Many incidents showing "N/A" for response times
  * Cause: Missing timestamp fields in source data
  * Solution: Work with CAD administrator to include complete time fields
- Negative Time Calculations:
  * Cause: Midnight rollover (clear time next day)
  * Solution: System automatically adjusts for 24-hour rollover

NFPA COMPLIANCE BENCHMARKS:
- Excellent Performance: 95%+ compliance across all metrics
- Good Performance: 85-94% compliance (industry average)
- Needs Improvement: 70-84% compliance (focus areas identified)
- Critical Issues: <70% compliance (significant operational changes needed)

PROFESSIONAL USE CASES:
- Monthly city council presentations: Professional compliance reporting
- Budget justification: Performance data supporting resource requests
- Operational improvement: Identify specific areas needing attention
- Regional comparisons: Benchmark against similar departments
- Grant applications: Professional performance documentation

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TOOLS:
- Data Formatter: Clean, validated data for accurate calculations
- Fire Map Pro: Geographic context for response time analysis
- Professional Reports: Executive-ready compliance documentation
- Template Management: Consistent monthly analysis workflows
