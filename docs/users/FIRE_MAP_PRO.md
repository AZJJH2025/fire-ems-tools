## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Mapping Problems**
**Issue**: "Incidents not appearing on map"
**Solution**: 
- Verify latitude/longitude fields contain numeric values
- Check coordinate format (decimal degrees preferred)
- Ensure coordinates are within reasonable range (-180 to 180)

**Issue**: "Map loads but no incidents visible"
**Solution**:
- Check zoom level - may need to zoom out to see all incidents
- Verify incident data has been properly imported
- Check filter settings - may be filtering out all incidents

### **Performance Issues**
**Issue**: "Map loads slowly with large datasets"
**Solution**:
- Use incident clustering for datasets over 1,000 incidents
- Apply time filters to reduce data volume
- Consider creating separate maps for different time periods

**Issue**: "Browser becomes unresponsive"
**Solution**:
- Reduce number of visible incidents using filters
- Close other browser tabs to free memory
- Consider using a more powerful computer for very large datasets

### **Data Quality Issues**
**Issue**: "Incidents appear in wrong locations"
**Solution**:
- Verify coordinate accuracy in source data
- Check for latitude/longitude field mix-ups
- Ensure coordinates match the expected geographic area

**Issue**: "Missing incidents on map"
**Solution**:
- Check for blank or invalid coordinates in data
- Verify all required fields are properly mapped
- Review import process for any error messages

## üìà **Best Practices**

### **Data Preparation**

2. **Appropriate Colors**: Use color schemes that are clear and professional
3. **Logical Grouping**: Group similar incident types for clarity
4. **Context Information**: Include relevant geographic context (streets, landmarks)

### **Analysis Methodology**
1. **Sufficient Data**: Use adequate time periods for meaningful patterns
2. **Multiple Views**: Analyze data from multiple perspectives (time, type, location)
3. **Context Awareness**: Consider external factors affecting incident patterns
4. **Regular Review**: Conduct quarterly geographic analysis for trend identification

### **Professional Presentation**
1. **Executive Summaries**: Create high-level maps for leadership
2. **Supporting Details**: Provide detailed analysis behind summary maps
