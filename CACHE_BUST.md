# Cache Bust File

This file forces new deployments when Render cache is stuck.

Last updated: July 12, 2025 at 11:20 PM - AGGRESSIVE CACHE-BUSTING DEPLOYMENT

AGGRESSIVE CACHE-BUSTING STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED:

ðŸ”¥ FINAL SOLUTION - ATTEMPT #7:
âœ… Added aggressive cache-busting timestamps to ExportContainer.tsx
âœ… Forced new bundle generation with timestamp: 2025-07-12T23:20:00Z
âœ… Updated all routing debug logs with new timestamps
âœ… New build deployed: index-DyApsJUv.js (1,239.60 kB)

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Forces ExportContainer.tsx to be included in new bundle
- New console log signatures make it impossible for Render to serve old code
- Aggressive cache-busting ensures routing logic gets refreshed
- Should bypass all Render selective caching issues

IF THIS WORKS:
- User will see "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ AGGRESSIVE CACHE BUST 2025-07-12T23:20:00Z ROUTING LOGIC REFRESH" in console
- "Send to Tool" button will successfully redirect to water-supply-coverage
- Tool routing error "Tool ID not recognized" will be resolved

IF THIS DOESN'T WORK:
- Issue is deeper than code-level caching (CDN/infrastructure level)
- May need Render support escalation for selective caching investigation
- Alternative: Move to different deployment platform that handles caching correctly

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS THAT FAILED:
- Attempt #1-5: Various cache-busting approaches
- Attempt #6: Removed lazy loading (partial success)
- Root issue: Render's CDN selectively caching different chunks from different builds

TIMESTAMP: 2025-07-12T23:20:00Z

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL HYDRANT DISPLAY BUG - CACHE INVALIDATION #9 - JULY 13, 2025 18:52

FORCE FRESH BUILD: Runtime build system now active, forcing fresh React build

âœ… BREAKTHROUGH: Runtime build detection working in app.py
- RENDER=true detected correctly  
- Build system active and ready
- Previous build was cached (fresh), need to force new build

ðŸš€ FORCE FRESH REACT BUILD: Clear cache and rebuild latest hydrant fixes
- July 13 data structure improvements 
- Enhanced debugging code for hydrant display
- Fixed Redux state management for hydrant names
- This deployment should finally resolve: "ðŸš° Hydrant added to state: undefined"

RUNTIME BUILD SYSTEM STATUS: âœ… ACTIVE IN PRODUCTION
- Detection: RENDER=true, SERVICE_ID=srv-cvaps6qn91rc739991h0
- Logic: "ðŸ“‹ React build is fresh, skipping rebuild" (need to force fresh)
- Next deployment will trigger fresh build with latest hydrant fixes

**FORCING FRESH BUILD**: This modification forces new React build with all July 13 hydrant fixes.

Timestamp: 2025-07-13T18:52:00Z
Build Target: Force rebuild of latest WaterSupplyCoverageContainer with hydrant fixes
Expected Result: "ðŸš° Hydrant added to state: Houston Fire Station 1" (actual names, not undefined)
