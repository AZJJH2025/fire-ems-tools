# Cache Bust File

This file forces new deployments when Render cache is stuck.

Last updated: July 12, 2025 at 11:20 PM - AGGRESSIVE CACHE-BUSTING DEPLOYMENT

AGGRESSIVE CACHE-BUSTING STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED:

ðŸ”¥ FINAL SOLUTION - ATTEMPT #7:
âœ… Added aggressive cache-busting timestamps to ExportContainer.tsx
âœ… Forced new bundle generation with timestamp: 2025-07-12T23:20:00Z
âœ… Updated all routing debug logs with new timestamps
âœ… New build deployed: index-DyApsJUv.js (1,239.60 kB)

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Forces ExportContainer.tsx to be included in new bundle
- New console log signatures make it impossible for Render to serve old code
- Aggressive cache-busting ensures routing logic gets refreshed
- Should bypass all Render selective caching issues

IF THIS WORKS:
- User will see "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ AGGRESSIVE CACHE BUST 2025-07-12T23:20:00Z ROUTING LOGIC REFRESH" in console
- "Send to Tool" button will successfully redirect to water-supply-coverage
- Tool routing error "Tool ID not recognized" will be resolved

IF THIS DOESN'T WORK:
- Issue is deeper than code-level caching (CDN/infrastructure level)
- May need Render support escalation for selective caching investigation
- Alternative: Move to different deployment platform that handles caching correctly

PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS THAT FAILED:
- Attempt #1-5: Various cache-busting approaches
- Attempt #6: Removed lazy loading (partial success)
- Root issue: Render's CDN selectively caching different chunks from different builds

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL HYDRANT DISPLAY BUG - CACHE INVALIDATION #8 - JULY 13, 2025 02:15

HYDRANT DATA STRUCTURE FIXES NOT REACHING PRODUCTION:
- Fixed hydrant data structure mismatch in commit 460868b9
- Console logs show production still running old code
- Still seeing: "ðŸš° Hydrant added to state: undefined"
- Map still shows: "0 hydrants displayed" despite processing 100 records

BUNDLE FILES STILL OLD:
- WaterSupplyCoverageContainer-BriB5_0M.js (old version)
- index-_BNWM61A.js (old version) 
- Need new bundle generation with fixed hydrant structure

DEPLOYMENT CACHE ISSUE SEVERITY: CRITICAL
- Blocks core Water Supply Coverage functionality
- 100 hydrant records processed but not displayed on map
- Data structure fixes committed but not deployed

**FORCING DEPLOYMENT REFRESH**: This modification will trigger new build with hydrant fixes included.

Timestamp: 2025-07-13T02:15:00Z
Build Target: Include hydrant data structure fixes from commit 460868b9
Expected Result: Hydrants will display properly on map with correct Redux state structure
