# Data Formatter to Response Time Analyzer Field Mapping Issue

## Problem
When transferring data from the Data Formatter to the Response Time Analyzer, field names were not being properly transformed from "Incident ID" format (with spaces) to "incidentId" format (camelCase). This caused the Response Time Analyzer to display "NA" values because it couldn't find the expected fields in the received data.

## Root Cause
The field name transformation logic in `ExportContainer.tsx` should convert field names from "Field Name" format to "fieldName" format before storing them in sessionStorage. However, even when this logic was correctly implemented, the changes weren't being reflected in the application.

The issue was related to the deployment process - changes to the React application weren't being properly deployed to the Flask server's static directories, causing the server to continue serving old JavaScript files.

## Solution
We implemented a two-part solution:

1. Enhanced the field name transformation in `ExportContainer.tsx` to ensure proper conversion from "Field Name" to "fieldName" format.
   
2. Added field name normalization in `ResponseTimeAnalyzerContainer.tsx` to handle both formats (with spaces and camelCase), making the analyzer more robust.

Most importantly, we ensured the changes were properly deployed using:
```
./deploy_react.sh
./restart_server.sh
```

## Existing Infrastructure
The system already has a `field-mapping-adapter.js` that handles field name transformation, but it needs to be properly deployed to take effect.

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:

1. Always run the full deployment process after making changes:
   ```
   npm run build
   ./deploy_react.sh
   ./restart_server.sh
   ```

2. Check the paths in the HTML files to ensure assets are properly referenced:
   - Files should be in `/Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/static/react-data-formatter/` and `/Users/josephhester/fire-ems-tools/static/react-response-time-analyzer/`
   - Make sure script paths are correct in the HTML files:
     ```html
     <!-- Use absolute path with leading slash -->
     <script type="module" crossorigin src="/react-response-time-analyzer/assets/index-BKnw2AOe.js"></script>
     ```

3. Verify the server is running correctly:
   - Kill any existing server processes: `pkill -f "python"`
   - Restart the server: `./restart_server.sh`
   - Check response: `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:5006/response-time-analyzer`

4. Verify deployment by checking server logs and browser network requests to ensure new files are being served.

5. Add debugging logs to check field name transformation when troubleshooting data transfer issues.

6. Run the field name transformation tests to verify the transformation works correctly:
   ```
   cd /path/to/fire-ems-tools/e2e/tests
   node test-export-container-field-transform.js
   ```
