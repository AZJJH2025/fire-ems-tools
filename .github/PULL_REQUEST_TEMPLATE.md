# Pull Request: Fix Deployment Issues

## Summary
- Fixed app structure to properly initialize Flask app before defining routes
- Added reliable error handling for map exports in FireMapPro
- Enhanced timeout handling for Chart.js in Call Volume Forecaster
- Improved fetch error handling in Quick Stats feature
- Added large file upload support for Data Formatter

## Background
The application was encountering deployment issues where routes were defined before the Flask app was created, causing "name 'app' is not defined" errors. Additionally, several JavaScript components were not handling errors correctly, causing problems in production environments.

## Changes Made

- Added deployment_fix.py and app_structure_fix.py scripts to diagnose and fix issues
- Created comprehensive deployment documentation
- Ensured database compatibility with fix_deployment.py script
- Added enhanced error handling to all JavaScript components
- Added reliable cleanup for DOM elements in map export function

## Testing
- Verified app loads correctly with restructured app.py
- Tested FireMapPro export with different browser and server configurations
- Validated Call Volume Forecaster with multiple data formats
- Confirmed Quick Stats properly handles network errors
- Tested Data Formatter with large file uploads

## Deployment Notes
- Application now has a /deployment-status endpoint for verifying fixes
- Database schema compatibility is automatically handled on startup
- JavaScript fixes are applied without requiring code changes
- See DEPLOYMENT_QUICKFIX.md for detailed instructions
