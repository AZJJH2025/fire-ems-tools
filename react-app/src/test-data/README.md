# Fire Department Test Data Collection

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive test data representing real-world CAD system exports from major fire department vendors. Each CSV file simulates specific data challenges and patterns found in actual fire department environments.

## Research Foundation
Test data was created based on extensive web research of:
- **Tyler Technologies** (30% market share) - New World CAD systems
- **Hexagon/Intergraph** (25% market share) - HxGN OnCall Dispatch
- **TriTech/CentralSquare** (20% market share) - Enterprise CAD solutions
- **NFIRS 5.0 standards** - National Fire Incident Reporting System
- **Small/volunteer departments** (65% of firefighters) - Basic record keeping

## Test Data Files

### 1. tyler_cad_split_datetime.csv
**Simulates:** Tyler Technologies New World CAD export format
**Key Challenges:**
- Split date/time fields requiring combination
- NFIRS incident type codes (111, 321, etc.)
- Tyler-specific field naming conventions
- Empty string handling for missing data
- Multiple separate time columns

### 2. hexagon_combined_datetime.csv  
**Simulates:** Hexagon/Intergraph HxGN OnCall export format
**Key Challenges:**
- Combined datetime in single field
- Inconsistent seconds formatting (some missing)
- Complex unit identifiers (ENG01-STATION12)
- Mixed location data (coordinates vs addresses only)
- Hexagon-specific field naming

### 3. tritech_narrative_heavy.csv
**Simulates:** TriTech/CentralSquare CAD with extensive narrative content
**Key Challenges:**
- Critical data buried in long narrative text
- Multiple narrative fields with overlapping information
- Mixed incident type formats (codes + free text)
- CentralSquare-specific field naming
- Heavy reliance on unstructured text data

### 4. volunteer_dept_minimal.csv
**Simulates:** Small volunteer fire department basic record keeping
**Key Challenges:**
- Minimal data structure (only essential fields)
- Manual data entry with inconsistencies
- Local terminology instead of standard codes
- Simple time formats without full precision
- Limited technical infrastructure

### 5. houston_fd_working.csv
**Simulates:** Well-structured municipal department data (baseline)
**Key Characteristics:**
- Combined datetime format that works correctly
- Standard field naming conventions
- Complete timestamp data for all incidents
- Good data quality for validation testing
- Reference standard for system capabilities

## Problem Documentation
See `test-data-problems.md` for detailed analysis of each data challenge and the specific problems our Universal Data Normalization Engine must solve.

## Usage in Development

### Testing Data Import
```bash
# Test each file individually in Data Formatter
# Upload -> Auto-mapping -> Validation -> Tool export
```

### Field Mapping Validation
- Tyler: Tests split datetime auto-combination
- Hexagon: Tests combined datetime parsing
- TriTech: Tests narrative parsing extraction
- Volunteer: Tests minimal data handling
- Houston: Tests preservation of good data

### Tool Integration Testing
- Response Time Analyzer: Needs incident_id, incident_date, timestamp fields
- Fire Map Pro: Needs latitude, longitude, incident details
- PDF Reports: Needs incident classification and performance data

## Real-World Impact

**Market Coverage:**
- Tyler + Hexagon + TriTech = 75% of fire department CAD systems
- Volunteer departments = 65% of all firefighters
- Combined test scenarios = 80%+ of real-world data challenges

**Validation Approach:**
- Each file represents a different pain point fire departments face
- Progressive complexity: Simple volunteer → Complex narrative-heavy
- Reference baseline: Houston FD shows what good data looks like

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios
- International address formats
- Multi-agency mutual aid responses
- Equipment tracking and maintenance records
- Training and certification data

### Enhanced Problem Categories
- Phone number format variations
- Unit identifier parsing patterns
- Geographic coordinate system variations
- Time zone handling across departments

### Integration Testing
- Multi-file batch processing
- Department template learning
- Cross-tool data flow validation
- Performance testing with larger datasets

## Contributing Guidelines

When adding new test data:
1. Research actual CAD vendor documentation
2. Document specific problems in `test-data-problems.md`
3. Include both common and edge cases
4. Test with actual tool integration
5. Verify problems can be solved systematically

## Key Success Metrics

**System Must Handle:**
- ✅ Split vs combined datetime fields (80% of departments)
- ✅ Field name mapping variations (top 20 most common)
- ✅ Narrative text parsing for missing data
- ✅ Empty/null data normalization
- ✅ Preserve quality data unchanged

**Target User Experience:**
- Small departments: "It just works" with minimal configuration
- Large departments: Advanced features when data supports them
- All departments: Professional results suitable for compliance reporting
