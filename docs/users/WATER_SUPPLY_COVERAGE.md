# Water Supply Coverage Analysis - User Guide

## Overview

The Water Supply Coverage Analysis tool helps fire departments assess and optimize their water supply infrastructure, including fire hydrants, water tanks, and mixed coverage systems. This tool is essential for ensuring adequate water supply for firefighting operations and identifying coverage gaps.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Upload Your Data
- **Hydrant Data**: CSV or Excel file with hydrant locations and flow rates
- **Tank Data**: CSV or Excel file with tank locations and capacities
- **Station Data**: Fire station locations for coverage analysis

### Step 2: Field Mapping
The tool will automatically detect and map common field names:
- **Location Fields**: Latitude, Longitude, Address
- **Hydrant Fields**: Flow Rate (GPM), Pressure (PSI), Hydrant ID
- **Tank Fields**: Capacity (Gallons), Tank Type, Tank ID

### Step 3: Configure Coverage Settings
- **Coverage Radius**: Set distance for adequate water supply (typically 1000-1500 feet)
- **Minimum Flow Rate**: Set required GPM for effective firefighting
- **Tank vs Hydrant Priority**: Configure mixed infrastructure priorities

## Key Features

### Interactive Water Supply Map
- **Visual Coverage Areas**: See coverage zones for each water source
- **Gap Identification**: Red areas indicate insufficient water supply
- **Flow Rate Visualization**: Color-coded hydrants by flow capacity
- **Tank Integration**: Mixed hydrant/tank coverage display

### Coverage Analysis Reports
- **NFPA 1142 Compliance**: Rural water supply standard analysis
- **ISO Credit Assessment**: Water supply scoring for ISO ratings
- **Coverage Gap Report**: Detailed list of under-served areas
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Prioritized infrastructure improvements

### Professional Export Options
- **Coverage Maps**: High-resolution maps for presentations

## Use Cases by Department Type

### Urban Departments (Hydrant-Based)
- **Hydrant Flow Testing**: Map and analyze flow test results
- **Coverage Verification**: Ensure adequate hydrant spacing
- **Pressure Analysis**: Identify low-pressure areas
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Plan new hydrant installations

### Rural Departments (Tank-Based)
- **Tank Placement**: Optimize tank locations for maximum coverage
- **Capacity Planning**: Ensure adequate water storage
- **Mutual Aid Coordination**: Share water resources with neighboring departments
- **NFPA 1142 Compliance**: Meet rural firefighting standards

### Mixed Infrastructure Departments
- **Hybrid Coverage**: Combine hydrant and tank coverage analysis
- **Resource Optimization**: Balance hydrant and tank investments
- **Redundancy Planning**: Ensure backup water sources
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Compare infrastructure options
