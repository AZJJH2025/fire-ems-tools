# ISO Credit Calculator - User Guide

## Overview

The ISO Credit Calculator helps fire departments assess their ISO (Insurance Services Office) classification rating on the 1-10 scale. A better ISO rating (lower number) can significantly reduce property insurance costs for your community, making this tool valuable for both fire departments and municipal leaders.

## Understanding ISO Ratings

### What is ISO Rating?
- **Scale**: 1 (best) to 10 (worst) classification
- **Impact**: Lower ratings reduce community insurance premiums
- **Savings**: Class 1-4 communities can save 10-15% on property insurance
- **Frequency**: ISO typically reviews departments every 10 years

### ISO Rating Components
1. **Fire Department (50%)**: Equipment, staffing, training, station distribution
2. **Water Supply (40%)**: Hydrants, flow rates, pressure, reliability
3. **Communications (10%)**: Dispatch capabilities, alarm systems

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Gather Required Data
Before using the calculator, collect:
- **Department Information**: Staffing levels, training records, equipment inventory
- **Station Data**: Locations, response areas, apparatus details
- **Water Supply Data**: Hydrant flow tests, pressure measurements
- **Communications Data**: Dispatch times, backup systems

### Step 2: Fire Department Assessment
Input your department's capabilities:
- **Staffing**: Career vs volunteer, response times, on-duty personnel
- **Training**: Certification levels, training hours, specialized training
- **Equipment**: Pumpers, ladders, rescue equipment, maintenance records
- **Leadership**: Officer qualifications, department organization

### Step 3: Water Supply Evaluation
Assess your water infrastructure:
- **Hydrant System**: Spacing, flow rates, pressure testing
- **Water Source**: Reliability, capacity, backup systems
- **Distribution**: Pipe sizes, pressure zones, storage capacity
- **Testing Program**: Regular flow testing, documentation

### Step 4: Communications Review
Evaluate dispatch and communications:
- **Dispatch Center**: Staffing, training, backup systems
- **Response Times**: Call processing, turnout times
- **Equipment**: Radio systems, alerting methods
- **Documentation**: Record keeping, performance tracking
