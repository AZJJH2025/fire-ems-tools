# Cache Bust File

This file forces new deployments when Render cache is stuck.

Last updated: July 12, 2025 at 8:45 PM - TARGETED ROUTING FIX

RENDER SELECTIVE CACHING ISSUE DISCOVERED:
- Some July 12 code IS working (data transformation, compatibility checking)  
- Routing logic ExportContainer.tsx STILL serving from June 13 build
- Missing our added debug logs proves routing code not updated
- This is selective caching where different app parts serve from different builds

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - LAZY LOADING + CHUNK SPLITTING ISSUE!

🚨 DEEP DIVE AUDIT SUCCESSFUL - FOUND THE REAL PROBLEM:
✅ App component was lazy loaded: `const App = React.lazy(() => import('./App'));`
✅ ExportContainer is inside App component (step 3 of stepper)
✅ Vite config has manual chunk splitting creating separate bundles
✅ Different chunks cached independently by browser/CDN
✅ Data transformation (different chunk) = July 12 code ✅
✅ ExportContainer (lazy chunk) = June 13 code ❌

SOLUTION - ATTEMPT #6:
🔧 Removed lazy loading for App component - direct import
🔧 Removed dynamic basename that could cause routing issues  
🔧 Forces ExportContainer into main bundle instead of separate chunk
🔧 Should eliminate selective caching entirely

This explains EVERYTHING:
- Why some July 12 features worked (main bundle)
- Why routing failed (lazy-loaded chunk still cached from June 13)
- Why cache busts didn't work (only affected main bundle, not lazy chunks)
