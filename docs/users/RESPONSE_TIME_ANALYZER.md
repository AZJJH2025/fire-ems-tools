- Ensure you have all required time fields (call received, dispatch, arrival)
- Check that incident types are properly classified
- Verify time data is complete and accurate

**Issue**: "Poor compliance scores"
**Solution**:
- Review data quality - incomplete records skew results
- Check for systematic time recording issues
- Consider department-specific factors affecting compliance

### **Report Generation Problems**
**Issue**: "Report generation fails"
**Solution**:
- Ensure analysis has been completed first
- Check that all required report fields are populated
- Verify department information is complete

**Issue**: "Charts not displaying properly"
**Solution**:
